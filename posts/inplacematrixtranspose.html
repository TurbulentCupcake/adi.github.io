    <h1>In-place matrix transpose</h1>

    <h3>1. Background </h3>
    <div style="max-width: 40%;">

    <p >
        While first getting my feet wet with concurrency, building a linear algebra library seemed like a pretty simple project to get started with. 
        Many operations such as addition and multiplication in linear algebra lend themselves well to parallelization due to the mutually exclusive 
        nature of their execution. For instance, adding two  matrices <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is simply adding each element in <i>A</i> to its corresponding element in the same position in matrix <i>B</i>. 
        Due to the independent nature of each addition operation, it is fairly straightforward to parallalize it. Similar parallelizable chunks exist when attempting to 
        multiply two matrices. Given two matries <i>A</i><sub><i>m</i>x<i>n</i></sub> and <i>B</i><sub><i>m</i>x<i>n</i></sub>, we can determine their product  
        <i>W</i> as <i>A</i><sup>T</sup><i>B</i>. However the challenge in this case is not the multiplication of the two matrices, but rather in the tranpose operation of <i>A</i> to <i>A</i><sup>T</sup>. 
        Confused? Let me explain!
        <br/>
        <br/>

        When manipulating matrices for high-performance purposes, it is more efficient to store them as one-dimensional arrays rather than their commonly used 
        two-dimensional form. For instance, a matrix <i>A</i><sub>2x3</sub>:
        
        <table class="matrix">
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>9</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        

        can be written as [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 9] in column-major order. This allows the matrix to be stored contiguously in memory, thus enabling better
        spatial locality and caching behavior. Access patterns that rely on sequential access of data (such as matrix addition and multiplication operations) benefit from this 
        optimization. However, in order for the matrix multiplication operation to exploit this optimization, it is important for the transposed multiplicand matrix to also be stored contiguously 
        in memory. For example, let us assume that the previously mentioned  <i>A</i><sub>2x3</sub> is the multiplicand in a matrix multiplication operation. Then <i>A</i><sup>T</sup> is written as:
        <table class="matrix">
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>9</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        which in its one-dimensional form is stored in memory as [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 9].

        <br/>
        <br/>
        So the question is, how do we go from [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 9] to [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 9]?
        <br/>
        One option is to "read" the matrix as though it were transposed, as done in the code below: 
     
        
        <br/>
        <code>
            <pre>
            for(i = 0 ; i < numRows ; i++) { 
              for(int j = i ; j < numRows*numCols ; j += numRows) {
                    System.out.println(matA[j]);
                }
            }
            </pre>
        </code>

        The drawback of this method is poor cache utilization. The code above reads every <code>numRows</code><sup>th</sup> position each access. 
        If numRows is large enough, this can result in consecutive
        cache misses, which in turn causes severe performance degradation as each new page has to be brought into cache. <br/> <br/>

        Another option is to create a new array of the same size (eg: A_t) that fills in values into the array such that it is in transposed form.
        However, this would mean consuming twice the memory of the original matrix. Given a large enough matrix, we will potentially run
        out of heap space to store its transpose. <br/> <br/>

        Thus, our remaining option is to transpose a matrix in-place. <br/> <br/>

        <h2>2. Method</h2>

        <p>
            Transposing a matrix in-place is best explained using an example. Let us assume we are given a matrix <i>A</i><sub>2x4</sub> as follows:
            <table class="matrix">
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br/>
            Assuming column major order, this matrix is stored in memory as [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]. Its transpose, <i>A</i><sup>T</sup>  would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]: 
            <table class="matrix">
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br/>
            <h3>2.1 Finding cycles</h3>

            The trick is to find cycles in permutations of indexes of the array containing the matrix. A cycle in this context is defined 
            as a permutation of indexes such that the value at each index will shift to the next index in that cycle until each index been visited. 
            The challenge is to be able to locate each such cycle.
            Let us illustrate with our matrix <i>A</i> as represented in its one-dimensional form below:  

            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            For each position in the array, we can determine the next position in the cycle using the following formula:
            
            <div class="code" >
                <code>
                    nextPos = numCols*currPos % (numCols*numRows - 1) 
                </code>
                s.t <code>currPos</code> != <code>numCols*numRows - 1</code> (F2.1)
            </div>

            Using this formula, let us determine one such cycle starting at index 1 (<code>currPos = 1</code>). Given that <code>numRows = 2</code> and 
            <code>numCols = 4</code>, the following table describes the construction of that cycle :


            <table style="width:100%">
                <caption>Table 1.</caption>
                <tr>
                  <th><code>currPos</code></th>
                  <th><code>numCols*currPos % (numCols*numRows - 1)</code></th> 
                  <th><code>nextPos</code></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">4*1 % (2*4 - 1)</td>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">4*4 % (2*4 - 1)</td>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">4*2 % (2*4 - 1)</td>
                  <td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              When <code>nextPos</code> returns to the original index ('1' in this case), we have obtained a cycle. From the table above, we can determine
              that the cycle beginning at index 1 is (1, 2, 4). This translates to the following moves:
              <pre><code>    A[1] -> A[4]
    A[4] -> A[2]
    A[2] -> A[1]
              </code></pre> 
              
              As a result of the three-way swap, our original array (with values at indexes present in the cycle indicated in red) :

            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, <font color="red">5</font>, <font color="red">2</font>, 6, <font color="red">3</font>, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            Now becomes this: 

            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, <font color="lightgreen">2</font>, <font color="lightgreen">3</font>, 6, <font color="lightgreen">5</font>, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            Thats pretty cool! We can see our transposed array coming together!

            In this manner, we can locate other sets of cycles by applying the formula defined in F2.1 to unvisited indexes. As a result, we obtain
            the cycle (3, 5, 6) by starting at index 3. Applying the same idea of shifting values at a given index to the next consecutive index as indicated 
            by the cycle, to the positions highighted in red:

            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, 2, 3, <font color="red">6</font>, 5, <font color="red">7</font>, <font color="red">4</font>, 8]</p>
            </div>

            We obtain the final transposed matrix:
            
            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, 2, 3, <font color="lightgreen">4</font>, 5, <font color="lightgreen">6</font>, <font color="lightgreen">7</font>, 8]</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2.2 Implementation </h3>

            While the logic described here can be applied to any programming language, i've used Java because that's the language I am (currently) most comfortable with.
            <br/> <br/>

            The first step in transposing is to find cycles, as described in section 2.1. To quote the Wikipedia article on this topic (sincere apologies my English teachers), 
            psuedocode would typically involve iterating over each cycle, as below: 
            <pre>
    <code>
        for each length>1 cycle C of the permutation
        pick a starting address s in C
        let D = data at s
        let x = predecessor of s in the cycle
        while x ≠ s
            move data from x to successor of x
            let x = predecessor of x
        move data from D to successor of s
    </code>
            </pre>

            However, it is inefficient to prediscover cycles for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>It would require additional space approximately equal to the size of the array to be transposed, since we 
                    will need to store cycle sets that contain every index in the array (caveat in the discussion section).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even if we did use an additional space to store cycle sets, we would be iterating through the the array once again. 
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/>

            Solution? Find cycles on the fly! You can find the code for this implementation <a href="https://github.com/TurbulentCupcake/java-concurrenc/blob/287ceafadfff59540cbe035145cc5b1352d1fd3e/concurrency/src/main/java/com/adi/concurrency/matrix/MatrixMethods.java#L170">here</a>,
            also pasted below. 

            <pre>
                <code>
1         for(int i = start; i < end ; i++) {
2 
3             int bytePos = i/Byte.SIZE; // locate the position at which the byte for this array is located
4             if((visitedArray[bytePos] & (1 << (i%Byte.SIZE))) == 0) {
5                 int firstPos = i;
6                 int nextPos = getNextPosition(numCols, firstPos, valueCount);
7                 int terminalPos = nextPos;
8                 int v1 = m[firstPos];
9                 int v2 = m[nextPos];
10                 int temp = 0;
11                 do { // replace with more concrete condition
12 
13                     // fix value
14                     m[nextPos] = v1;
15 
16                     // set nextPos bit in visitedArray
17                     bytePos = nextPos/Byte.SIZE;
18                     visitedArray[bytePos] |= (1 << (nextPos%Byte.SIZE));
19 
20                     // compute next position
21                     nextPos = getNextPosition(numCols, nextPos, valueCount);
22 
23                     // do the swap
24                     temp = v2;
25                     v2 = m[nextPos];
26                     v1 = temp;
27 
28                 } while (nextPos != terminalPos);
29 
30             }
31         }
                </code>
            </pre>

            In essence, the code above treats every index as the start of a new cycle set. If the index has already been visited (already part of a cycle), it attempts to locate a new cycle from the next index.
            Starting at each index, the next index to be added to the cycle set is located using <code><a href="https://github.com/TurbulentCupcake/java-concurrenc/blob/287ceafadfff59540cbe035145cc5b1352d1fd3e/concurrency/src/main/java/com/adi/concurrency/matrix/MatrixMethods.java#L213">getNextPosition</a> </code>and its value is 
            saved. The value at the original index is then placed at the index located by <code>getNextPosition</code>. In this manner, we move the value at each index to the next one until we return to the index at which we initiated the cycle.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Using our original example from 2.1, we use the matrix <i>A</i> as given below in its one-dimensional form. Let us call it <code>m</code>:


            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            Starting at <code>i = 1</code> (ignore the condition at 4 for now), we derive that <code>getNextPosition</code> returns 4 (refer to Table 1.). 
            Thus, <code>firstPos = 1</code> and <code>nextPos = 4</code> and as a result <code>v1 = 5</code> and <code>v2 = 3</code>. Once we enter the <code>do-while</code>. 
            We set the value at <code>nextPos</code> to v1. Thus, <code>m</code> at this point is as follows:

            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, 5, 2, 6, <font color="red">5</font>, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            At this point, we recompute the next position at line 21. This time, we determine that <code>nextPos = 2</code>. In lines 23 - 25, we do a swap where we store the value of <code>v2</code> in <code>v1</code> and store the value at <code>nextPos</code> into <code>v2</code>.
            We do this because at the next iteration of the loop, line 14 sets <code>m[2] = 3</code> and <code>v2 = 2</code>. This translates to the following:
            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, 5, <font color="red">3</font>, 6, 5, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            Repeating the same process, arrive at the following.

            <div class="displayarray">
                <p class="array">[1, <font color="red">2</font>, 3, 6, 5, 7, 4, 8]</p>
            </div>

            In the last iteration of the loop, <code>terminalPos = nextPos = 4</code> which signals the end our cycle. At this point, values at each index have been shifted to the next index as indicated by the cycle set.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            In the next iteration of the loop in line 1, <code>i = 2</code>. However, we have already visited this index as part of the cycle set beginning at <code>i = 1</code>. In order to keep track of visited indexes, 
            we use a byte array where each bit represents whether an index has been visited as part of a cycle set. Thus, we create a byte array <code>visitedArray</code> of size <code>numCols*numRows/sizeof(byte)</code> bytes to record 
            whether a value at each index has been visited. 

            <br/>
            We determine the bit corresponding to an index by first locating the byte to which it belongs, done at line 3. In line 4, <code>i%Byte.SIZE</code> gives us the exact bit corresponding to our index in the <code>bytePos</code> byte.
            Line 4 as a whole essentially checks whether the bit corresponding to the index <code>i</code> is set to 0, if so it is unvisited and has not already been included in a cycle set. Similarly, line 21 sets the bit corresponding to <code>nextPos</code>
            in <code>visitedArray</code> once the value at the <code>nextPos</code> index has been set.

        <h3>3. Discussion</h3>

        While the initial intent of this exercise was to perform the matrix transpose operation without utilizing additional memory, 
        its probably worth noting that the transpose method described here itself is difficult to parallelize. 
        Unsynchronized writes to values at indexes described in a single cycle can cause data races. Taking the example of the matrix <code>m</code> in 2.2, 
        if we had a thread T1 that attempts to discover a cycle set starting at index 1 and a thread T2 that starts at index 2,  its possible that T2 is scheduled before T1 thus writing 2 to index 1 which 
        is then read by T1 and written to index 4. 
        For this reason, predetermining cycle sets enables us to provide better synchronization guarantees and prevent any potential race conditions by providing each thread a set of
        cycle sets to process.

        As it stands, the method described here is not the most efficient and certainly has room for imporvement. If you found a bug/logical flaw/improvement, feel free reach out to me at my <a href="mailto:muraliadithya315@gmail.com"> email</a>.
