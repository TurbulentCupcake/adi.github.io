        <h1>Does Kotlin get how lambda's work?</h1>

            <p>
                I must begin this mini rant(?) by noting that I am still learning Kotlin as a Java programmer. Thus, my understanding of the underlying
                 mechanics of Kotlin is nascent as of this writing. 
                <br/>
                That being said, I find Kotlin's implementation of lambda mechanics a bit confounding. Let's start with an example straight from the <a href='https://kotlinlang.org/docs/returns.html#return-at-labels'>horse's mouth</a>:
                <pre>
                    <code>
        fun foo() {
            listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach {
                if (it == 3) return // non-local return directly to the caller of foo()
                print(it)
            }
            println("this point is unreachable")
        }

        fun main() {
            foo()
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                Which prints out <code>12</code>.
                As mentioned in the comment, the <code>return</code> statement returns from the function <code>foo()</code> to its caller. 
                Which... if you think about it for a second ....  is not how lambda expressions work? <br/>
                The equivalent(?) java code is as follows: 

                <pre>
                    <code>
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            foo();
        }
    
        public static void foo() {
    
            ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
            Collections.addAll(arrayList, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
            arrayList.forEach(it -> {
                if(it == 3) return;
                System.out.println(it);
            });
    
            System.out.println("Reached here");
    
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                which prints out the following:

                <pre>
                    <code>
    1
    2
    4
    5
    Reached here
                    </code>
                </pre>

                Which makes sense because lambda expressions do not and <i>should not</i> have context of callers or variables outside the scope of the calling code other than any
                parameters passed to the lambda itself. In both langauges, the caller of the lambda is the <code>forEach</code> and not the <code>foo()</code>.
                So <i>why on earth should a lamda expression</i> <code>return</code> <i>to</i> <code>foo()</code> <i>and not the</i> <code>forEach</code>?
                In Kotlin's defense, they do say that <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/returns.html#return-at-labels">"such non-local returns are supported only for lambda expressions passed to inline functions"</a>.
                However, why is this the default behavior for inline functions? Why must I then <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/returns.html#return-at-labels">annotate</a> my lambda to get the expected
                lambda behavior? In fact, why does this behavior exist at all? 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Don't even get me started on the lack of checked exceptions...
